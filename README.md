## Hi there 👋

My name is Henning, and I work at OTTO, a German online retailer. I'm also currently studying Computer Science at Nordakademie in Elmshorn, where I reside.

My passion lies in the cybersecurity sector. I've worked at OTTO for the past 1.5 years across different cybersecurity departments, focusing on both frontend and operations.

### 💻 Skills & Technologies

### 🚀 Current Projects & Learning
Currently, I'm developing a method to control my social media consumption through a filter, allowing me to "choose my poison," so to speak.
I'm also actively learning **Power BI** for dashboards we are designing for operations data.

### 📚 Recently Explored
In the past month, I've deepened my knowledge by reading "The Linux Command Line Bible," "Pro Git," and "The Software Architect's Handbook."
